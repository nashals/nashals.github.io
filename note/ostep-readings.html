其中一些觉得会比较有意思(都是值得阅读)的引用.
</p>
<p>
[B86] “The Design of the UNIX Operating System”
M.J. Bach
Prentice-Hall, 1986
One of the classic old books on how a real UNIX operating system is built; a definite must-read for kernel hackers.
</p>
<p>
[LM+89] “The Design and Implementation of the 4.3BSD UNIX Operating System”
S.J. Leffler, M.K. McKusick, M.J. Karels, J.S. Quarterman
Addison-Wesley, 1989
Another OS classic, written by four of the main people behind BSD. The later versions of this book, while more up to date, don’t quite match the beauty of this one.
</p>
<p>
[M06] “Solaris Internals: Solaris 10 and OpenSolaris Kernel Architecture”
Richard McDougall
Prentice-Hall, 2006
A good book about Solaris and how it works.
</p>
<p>
[O90] “Why Aren’t Operating Systems Getting Faster as Fast as Hardware?”
J. Ousterhout
USENIX Summer Conference, June 1990
A classic paper on the nature of operating system performance.
</p>
<p>
[SR05] “Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment”
W. Richard Stevens and Stephen A. Rago
Addison-Wesley, 2005
All nuances and subtleties of using UNIX APIs are found herein. Buy this book! Read it! And most importantly, live it.
</p>
<p>
[CK+08] “The xv6 Operating System”
Russ Cox, Frans Kaashoek, Robert Morris, Nickolai Zeldovich
From: <a href="http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2008/index.html">http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2008/index.html</a>
The coolest real and little OS in the world. Download and play with it to learn more about the details of how operating systems actually work.
xv6 was developed as a port of the original UNIX version 6 and represents a beautiful, clean, and simple way to understand a modern operating system.
</p>
<p>
[HP90] “Computer Architecture a Quantitative Approach” (1st ed.)
David A. Patterson and John L. Hennessy
Morgan-Kaufman, 1990
A book that encouraged each of us at our undergraduate institutions to pursue graduate studies; we later both had the pleasure of working with Patterson, who greatly shaped the foundations of our research careers.
</p>
<p>
[F96] “Six Easy Pieces: Essentials Of Physics Explained By Its Most Brilliant Teacher”
Richard P. Feynman
Basic Books, 1996
This book reprints the six easiest chapters of Feynman’s Lectures on Physics, from 1963. If you like Physics, it is a fantastic read
</p>
<p>
[B+10] “An Analysis of Linux Scalability to Many Cores Abstract”
Silas Boyd-Wickizer, Austin T. Clements, Yandong Mao, Aleksey Pesterev, M. Frans Kaashoek, Robert Morris, Nickolai Zeldovich
OSDI ’10, Vancouver, Canada, October 2010
A terrific modern paper on the difficulties of scaling Linux to many cores.
</p>
<p>
[BC05] “Understanding the Linux Kernel (Third Edition)”
Daniel P. Bovet and Marco Cesati
O’Reilly Media, November 2005
One of the many books you can find on Linux. They go out of date quickly, but many of the basics remain and are worth reading about.
</p>
<p>
[C03] “The Innovator’s Dilemma”
Clayton M. Christenson
Harper Paperbacks, January 2003
A fantastic book about the disk-drive industry and how new innovations disrupt existing ones. A good read for business majors and computer scientists alike. Provides insight on how large and successful companies completely fail.
</p>
<p>
[C93] “Inside Windows NT”
Helen Custer and David Solomon
Microsoft Press, 1993
The book about Windows NT that explains the system top to bottom, in more detail than you might like. But seriously, a pretty good book.
