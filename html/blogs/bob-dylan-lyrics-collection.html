<p class="verse">
Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?<br  />
Oh, where have you been, my darling young one?<br  />
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains<br  />
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways<br  />
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests<br  />
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans<br  />
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard<br  />
And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard<br  />
And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall<br  />
<br  />
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?<br  />
Oh, what did you see, my darling young one?<br  />
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it<br  />
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it<br  />
I saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin'<br  />
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleedin'<br  />
I saw a white ladder all covered with water<br  />
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken<br  />
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children<br  />
And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard<br  />
And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall<br  />
<br  />
And what did you hear, my blue-eyed son?<br  />
And what did you hear, my darling young one?<br  />
I heard the sound of a thunder, it roared out a warnin'<br  />
Heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world<br  />
Heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazin’<br  />
Heard ten thousand whisperin’ and nobody listenin’<br  />
Heard one person starve, I heard many people laughin'<br  />
Heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter<br  />
Heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley<br  />
And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard<br  />
And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall<br  />
<br  />
Oh, who did you meet, my blue-eyed son?<br  />
Who did you meet, my darling young one?<br  />
I met a young child beside a dead pony<br  />
I met a white man who walked a black dog<br  />
I met a young woman whose body was burning<br  />
I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow<br  />
I met one man who was wounded in love<br  />
I met another man who was wounded with hatred<br  />
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard<br  />
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall<br  />
<br  />
Oh, what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?<br  />
Oh, what'll you do now, my darling young one?<br  />
I'm a-goin' back out 'fore the rain starts a-fallin'<br  />
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest black forest<br  />
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty<br  />
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters<br  />
Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison<br  />
Where the executioner's face is always well-hidden<br  />
Where hunger is ugly, where souls are forgotten<br  />
Where black is the color, where none is the number<br  />
And I'll tell it and think it and speak it and breathe it<br  />
And reflect it from the mountain so all souls can see it<br  />
Then I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinkin'<br  />
But I'll know my song well before I start singin'<br  />
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard<br  />
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall<br  />

<h2 id="orgheadline2"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Mr Tambourine Man</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p class="verse">
Hey! Mr. Tambourine man, play a song for me<br  />
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to<br  />
Hey! Mr. Tambourine man, play a song for me<br  />
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you<br  />
<br  />
Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand<br  />
Vanished from my hand<br  />
Left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping<br  />
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet<br  />
I have no one to meet<br  />
And the ancient empty street's too dead for dreaming<br  />
<br  />
Hey! Mr. Tambourine man, play a song for me<br  />
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to<br  />
Hey! Mr. Tambourine man, play a song for me<br  />
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you<br  />
<br  />
Take me on a trip upon your magic swirling ship<br  />
My senses have been stripped<br  />
My hands can't feel to grip<br  />
My toes too numb to step<br  />
Wait only for my boot heels to be wandering<br  />
I'm ready to go anywhere, I'm ready for to fade<br  />
Into my own parade<br  />
Cast your dancing spell my way, I promise to go under it<br  />
<br  />
Hey! Mr. Tambourine man, play a song for me<br  />
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to<br  />
Hey! Mr. Tambourine man, play a song for me<br  />
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you<br  />
<br  />
Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun<br  />
It's not aimed at anyone<br  />
It's just escaping on the run<br  />
And but for the sky there are no fences facing<br  />
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme<br  />
To your tambourine in time<br  />
It's just a ragged clown behind<br  />
I wouldn't pay it any mind<br  />
It's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing<br  />
<br  />
Hey! Mr. Tambourine man, play a song for me<br  />
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to<br  />
Hey! Mr. Tambourine man, play a song for me<br  />
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you<br  />
<br  />
And take me disappearing through the smoke rings of my mind<br  />
Down the foggy ruins of time<br  />
Far past the frozen leaves<br  />
The haunted frightened trees<br  />
Out to the windy beach<br  />
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow<br  />
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky<br  />
With one hand waving free<br  />
Silhouetted by the sea<br  />
Circled by the circus sands<br  />
With all memory and fate<br  />
Driven deep beneath the waves<br  />
Let me forget about today until tomorrow<br  />
<br  />
Hey! Mr. Tambourine man, play a song for me<br  />
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to<br  />
Hey! Mr. Tambourine man, play a song for me<br  />
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you<br  />

<h2 id="orgheadline3"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> Desolation Row</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p class="verse">
They’re selling postcards of the hanging<br  />
They’re painting the passports brown<br  />
The beauty parlor is filled with sailors<br  />
The circus is in town<br  />
Here comes the blind commissioner<br  />
They’ve got him in a trance<br  />
One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker<br  />
The other is in his pants<br  />
And the riot squad they’re restless<br  />
They need somewhere to go<br  />
As Lady and I look out tonight<br  />
From Desolation Row<br  />
<br  />
Cinderella, she seems so easy<br  />
“It takes one to know one,” she smiles<br  />
And puts her hands in her back pockets<br  />
Bette Davis style<br  />
And in comes Romeo, he’s moaning<br  />
“You Belong to Me I Believe”<br  />
And someone says, “You’re in the wrong place my friend<br  />
You better leave”<br  />
And the only sound that’s left<br  />
After the ambulances go<br  />
Is Cinderella sweeping up<br  />
On Desolation Row<br  />
<br  />
Now the moon is almost hidden<br  />
The stars are beginning to hide<br  />
The fortune-telling lady<br  />
Has even taken all her things inside<br  />
All except for Cain and Abel<br  />
And the hunchback of Notre Dame<br  />
Everybody is making love<br  />
Or else expecting rain<br  />
And the Good Samaritan, he’s dressing<br  />
He’s getting ready for the show<br  />
He’s going to the carnival tonight<br  />
On Desolation Row<br  />
<br  />
Now Ophelia, she’s ’neath the window<br  />
For her I feel so afraid<br  />
On her twenty-second birthday<br  />
She already is an old maid<br  />
To her, death is quite romantic<br  />
She wears an iron vest<br  />
Her profession’s her religion<br  />
Her sin is her lifelessness<br  />
And though her eyes are fixed upon<br  />
Noah’s great rainbow<br  />
She spends her time peeking<br  />
Into Desolation Row<br  />
<br  />
Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood<br  />
With his memories in a trunk<br  />
Passed this way an hour ago<br  />
With his friend, a jealous monk<br  />
He looked so immaculately frightful<br  />
As he bummed a cigarette<br  />
Then he went off sniffing drainpipes<br  />
And reciting the alphabet<br  />
Now you would not think to look at him<br  />
But he was famous long ago<br  />
For playing the electric violin<br  />
On Desolation Row<br  />
<br  />
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world<br  />
Inside of a leather cup<br  />
But all his sexless patients<br  />
They’re trying to blow it up<br  />
Now his nurse, some local loser<br  />
She’s in charge of the cyanide hole<br  />
And she also keeps the cards that read<br  />
“Have Mercy on His Soul”<br  />
They all play on pennywhistles<br  />
You can hear them blow<br  />
If you lean your head out far enough<br  />
From Desolation Row<br  />
<br  />
Across the street they’ve nailed the curtains<br  />
They’re getting ready for the feast<br  />
The Phantom of the Opera<br  />
A perfect image of a priest<br  />
They’re spoonfeeding Casanova<br  />
To get him to feel more assured<br  />
Then they’ll kill him with self-confidence<br  />
After poisoning him with words<br  />
And the Phantom’s shouting to skinny girls<br  />
“Get Outa Here If You Don’t Know<br  />
Casanova is just being punished for going<br  />
To Desolation Row”<br  />
<br  />
Now at midnight all the agents<br  />
And the superhuman crew<br  />
Come out and round up everyone<br  />
That knows more than they do<br  />
Then they bring them to the factory<br  />
Where the heart-attack machine<br  />
Is strapped across their shoulders<br  />
And then the kerosene<br  />
Is brought down from the castles<br  />
By insurance men who go<br  />
Check to see that nobody is escaping<br  />
To Desolation Row<br  />
<br  />
Praise be to Nero’s Neptune<br  />
The Titanic sails at dawn<br  />
And everybody’s shouting<br  />
“Which Side Are You On?”<br  />
And Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot<br  />
Fighting in the captain’s tower<br  />
While calypso singers laugh at them<br  />
And fishermen hold flowers<br  />
Between the windows of the sea<br  />
Where lovely mermaids flow<br  />
And nobody has to think too much<br  />
About Desolation Row<br  />
<br  />
Yes, I received your letter yesterday<br  />
(About the time the doorknob broke)<br  />
When you asked how I was doing<br  />
Was that some kind of joke?<br  />
All these people that you mention<br  />
Yes, I know them, they’re quite lame<br  />
I had to rearrange their faces<br  />
And give them all another name<br  />
Right now I can’t read too good<br  />
Don’t send me no more letters, no<br  />
Not unless you mail them<br  />
From Desolation Row<br  />
